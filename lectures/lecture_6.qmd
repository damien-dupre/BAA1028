# Create a website with Markdown and Python Code embedded

## Quarto Websites

Quarto Websites are a convenient way to publish groups of documents. Documents published as part of a website share navigational elements, rendering options, and visual style.

Website navigation can be provided through a global navbar, a sidebar with links, or a combination of both for sites that have multiple levels of content. You can also enable full text search for websites.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://www.paulbarrs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/painful.jpg")
```

## Exercise 1: Quarto Website {background="#43464B"}

1. Open a new Terminal window in VS Code and run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto create project website mysite
```

and then:

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, warn_when = 60)
```

## Quarto Websites

```markdown
quarto create project website mysite
```

Creates a new website project from the Terminal. This website project is initiated by a folder called `mysite` located on the root of your terminal.

The folder contains only 4 files:

- `_quarto.yml` is a yaml file, it design the overall style and the navbar
- `index.qmd` is a quarto file, it corresponds to the homepage
- `about.qmd` is another quarto file which is displayed when about is clicked on the navbar
- `styles.css` is for additional style not defined in `_quarto.yml`

## Quarto Websites

Improve your Website:

- Navigation instructions here: [https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html)
- Option instructions here: [https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html)

## Quarto Websites

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```

This command is used to render the website by converting all the `.qmd` files to `.html` files stored in a `_site` folder. 

The website preview will open in a new web browser. As you edit and save `index.qmd` (or other files like `about.qmd`) the preview is automatically updated.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/media/rendered_site.png")
```

## .qmd Files

Unfortunately `.ipynb` files cannot be used to build a website. 

Thankfully they can be converted to `.qmd` format by quarto with the instruction: 

```markdown
quarto convert myfile.ipynb
```

`.qmd` files are actually very similar to `.ipynb` files and are tailored for quarto:

- They have a yaml displayed between two series of `---` signs
- They have markdown text
- They can have code cell, also called chunks

## .qmd Files

Chunks are delimited by 3 backticks on each end ` ``` ` followed by the engine (`python`) between curly braces `{python}` 

````markdown
```{{python}}
print('Hello, world!')
```
````

## Exercise 2: Convert a Notebook to .qmd {background="#43464B"}

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
1. Open a new Terminal window in VS Code and run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto convert hello.ipynb
```

2. Drag and drop the file `hello.qmd` created in the root of the `mysite` folder
:::

::: {#second-column}
3. Open the file `_quarto.yml` in Jupyter and modify it as follow:

```markdown
website:
  title: "Mysite"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
      - hello.qmd
```

4. In the same Terminal window, run the following instructions:

```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```
:::
::::


```{r}
countdown(minutes = 10, warn_when = 60)
```

# Publish this website on GitHub

## Overview

There are three ways to publish Quarto websites and documents to GitHub Pages:

- **Render sites on your local machine to the docs directory**, check the rendered site into GitHub, and then configure your GitHub repo to publish from the docs directory.

- **Use the quarto publish command** to publish content rendered on your local machine.

- **Use a GitHub Action** to automatically render your files (a single Quarto document or a Quarto project) and publish the resulting content whenever you push a source code change to your repository.

#### The simplest way to publish using GitHub Pages is to render to the docs directory and then upload that directory into your repository...

## Overview

#### ... but it won't be as easy as it looks I'm afraid!

```{r out.width='90%'}
include_graphics("http://techrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/github-dark-side.jpg")
```

## Render the Website docs Folder

In the `_quarto.yml` file, simply **change the output directory folder** to a folder named `docs` as follow:

```markdown
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Then preview or render the website:

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
```markdown
quarto render mysite
```
:::

::: {#second-column}
```markdown
quarto preview mysite
```
:::
::::

## Render the Website docs Folder

Your website default folder should look like that

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_img("mysite_docs.png")
```

Note: the old folder `_site` will not be used any more and is now useless.

## Add a .nojekyll File

Add a `.nojekyll` file to the root of your repository that tells GitHub Pages not to do additional processing of your published site using Jekyll (the GitHub default site generation tool):

You can create an empty text file by yourself or you can download this `nojekyll` file here:
```{r}
# downloadthis::download_file(
#   path = here::here("nojekyll"),
#   output_name = "nojekyll",
#   button_label = "Click here to download nojekyll",
#   has_icon = TRUE,
#   icon = "fa fa-save",
#   self_contained = FALSE
# )
```

You could also create it from the terminal when the website folder is the current directory:

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
Mac/Linux:
```markdown
cd mysite
touch .nojekyll
```
:::

::: {#second-column}
Windows:
```markdown
cd mysite
copy NUL .nojekyll
```
:::
::::

## Upload your Files to GitHub

When GitHub suggests ways how to upload files, it gives instructions to **create a new repository on the command line** with git.

For example:

```markdown
cd mysite #if not done yet
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/damiendupre/mysite.git
git push -u origin main
```

You should see all your files uploaded in your GitHub repository

## Exercise 3: Your Quarto Website in GitHub  {background="#43464B"}

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
1. **Change the output directory folder** to a folder named `docs` in the `_quarto.yml` file:

```markdown
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Then, preview or render the website

```markdown
quarto render mysite
```

2. **Upload and commit all the files contained in the website folder** on your GitHub repository, not the website folder itself.
:::

::: {#second-column}
3. **Upload and commit a nojekyll file** that tells GitHub to not run its default html website processing

You can download this `nojekyll` file here:

```{r}
# downloadthis::download_file(
#   path = here::here("nojekyll"),
#   output_name = "nojekyll",
#   button_label = "Click here to download nojekyll",
#   has_icon = TRUE,
#   icon = "fa fa-save",
#   self_contained = FALSE
# )
```

4. Finally, in **GitHub**, click **Settings** -> **Pages** choose:
- `main` branch
- `/docs` folder
- and Save
:::
::::

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 10, warn_when = 60)
```


## {background="#43464B"}

```{css, echo = FALSE}
img.circle {border-radius:50%;}
```

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
<img class="circle" src="https://github.com/damien-dupre.png" />
