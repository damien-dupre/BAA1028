# What is an ePortfolio?

## Definition

- An ePortfolio is a digital collection of materials that showcases an individual’s achievements, skills, experiences, and learning.
- It serves as both a personal and professional development tool.
-	Combines multimedia elements (text, images, videos, etc.) to enhance presentation.

### ePortfolio are also about what you don't include

- Quality over quantity! Don't throw in every student project
- Avoid sharing irrelevant information like data cleaning (just link to the file with the code) or personal information like phone number
- Check for grammar errors/clarity

## ePortfolio Platforms

- [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com): Free and user-friendly while having limited design options.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/): Visually appealing templates.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/): Customisable and scalable website for diverse purpose.
- [Loop Reflect/Mahara](https://www.dcu.ie/teu/learning-eportfolios): Designed for education and collaboration.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-portfolio-step-by-step-guide-showcase-your-work): Professional networking with portfolio integration.

...Just to name a few.

These services offer a **platform to design an eportfolio/website** and to **host the eportfolio/website on their own servers**.

Instead, we are going to **manually create** our eportfolio/website and to **host it on a specific server**.

# Talk to your Computer

## What is a command-line interface (CLI)? 

> A command-line interface (CLI) **processes commands** to a computer program in the form of **lines of text**. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. 

> Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS.

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

## What is a command-line interface (CLI)? 

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
### Command-Line Interface
- Text-based commands.
- Efficient for automation.
- Preferred by tech experts.
:::

::: {#second-column}
### Graphical User Interface
- Visual elements (icons, windows).
- User-friendly.
- Immediate visual feedback.
- Common for everyday tasks.
:::
::::

## Evolution of Computer Interfaces

- **1969**: UNIX introduces Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **1980**: MS-DOS popularizes Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **1984**: Apple Macintosh brings GUI to mainstream
- **1985**: Microsoft introduces Windows 1.0, a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **1991**: Linux introduces CLI to open source
- **1995**: Windows 95 merges GUI and CLI
- **2001**: Mac OS X merges Unix and GUI
- **2004**: Ubuntu simplifies Linux CLI 
- **2020s**: CLI continues its indispensable role, supporting automation, scripting, and advanced tasks. 

## And what is a shell?

> In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

## Terminal vs Shell

Vocabulary:

- **Terminal**: A program that runs a shell
- **Shell**: A program that interprets commands
- **Bash**: The most common shell on Linux
- **zsh**: The most common shell on MacOS
- **PowerShell**: The most common shell on Windows
- **Cmd**: The legacy shell on Windows

## Windows Terminal

A new CMD or PowerShell terminal application for Windows OS

## Okay, but why?!

- Fast and efficient way to interact with your computer

- Important part of your automation toolbox to create a reproducible data analysis pipeline

- Accessing a remote server almost always requires some sort of command line skills

[I also recommend "Top ten reasons to learn to use the command line: Expanding your reproducibility tools"](https://riffomonas.org/code_club/2020-08-17-command-line-life)

## Important Commands

| Description           | Win         | Linux, MacOS |
| :---                  | :---        | :---         |    
| Copy files, folders   | `copy`      | `cp`         |
| Move files, folders   | `move`      | `mv`         |
| List folder content   | `dir`       | `ls`         |
| Create new folder     | `mkdir`     | `mkdir`      |
| Change current folder | `cd`        | `cd`         |
| Show current path.    | `cd`        | `pwd`        |
| Locate a software     | `where`     | `which`      |
| **Danger zone** No undo!|
| Delete file(s)         | `del`      | `rm`         |
| Delete folder(s)       | `rmdir`.   | `rm`         |

## Your Turn: Access your Terminal {background="#43464B"}

1. Open a Terminal window
2. Show current path using `cd` or `pwd`
3. Print the path of your python installation using `where python` or `which python`

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 3, warn_when = 60)
```

# Paths, folders, and files

## What is a path?

> A path is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a location in a
directory structure. It is composed by following the directory tree hierarchy in which components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory.

> The **delimiting character** is most commonly the **slash ("/")**, the
**backslash character ("\\")**, or colon (":"), though some operating systems
may use a different delimiter. 

> Resources can be represented by either **absolute or relative paths**

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))

## Delimiting characters

Delimiting characters `/` or `\` vary by operating system

- MS Windows: 
  - Use a colon `:` to specify the drive name (e.g., `c:`, `d:`, `e:`)
  - Folders and files are separated by a backslash character (`\`)
  - Example: `C:\Damien\Documents\projects\damien-dupre.github.io\index.qmd`

- Linux/macOS:
  - No colon (`:`)
  - Use only the slash (`/`) character
  - Example: `/Users/Damien/Drive/projects/damien-dupre.github.io/index.qmd`
  
## Delimiting characters

- Software, such as R, $\LaTeX$, and Python, with a Linux/UNIX background behaves differently under MS Windows when it comes to specifying file/folder paths

- That is, when specifying a path (e.g., in Python) in MS Windows, these programs do not like the backslash character (`\`) (the backslash is used for "escaping" other characters)

## Delimiting characters

Two solutions in MS Windows:

1. Use the slash character `/` instead of `\`, e.g.:   

```python
import pandas
csv_file = pandas.read_csv('C:/Damien/myfolder/mysubfolder/mydata.csv')
```

2. Escape the backslash character via `\\`, e.g.:

```python
import pandas
csv_file = pandas.read_csv('C:\\Damien\\myfolder\\mysubfolder\\mydata.csv')
```

## Delimiting characters

Note: Many programming languages/statistical packages (R, Python, ...) can
dynamically create a full path that follows the rules of the respective
operating system

```python
import os
os.path.join("e:", "folder1", "folder2", "file")
```
returns: `'e:folder1\\folder2\\file'` (in Windows)

A handy tool when working on both operating system: [Path
Copy Copy -- Copy file paths from Windows explorer's contextual
menu](https://pathcopycopy.github.io/)

Mac users can left-click and press <kbd>option</kbd> to "copy as a Pathname"

## Relative vs. Absolute Paths

An absolute path specifies a file or directory location from the root directory.

Examples:

- **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
/Users/Username/Documents/file.txt
```
- **Windows:**
```bash
C:\Users\Username\Documents\file.txt
```

When accessing folders and files that you have created, the root directory is  followed by your home folder

## Relative vs. Absolute Paths

A relative path specifies a location relative to the current directory which is a "fixed location" on your computer

Often, this "fixed location" is the so-called "working directory" 

- The dot `.` denotes the current working directory
- The dot dot `..` denotes the parent directory, i.e., it points upwards in the folder hierarchy
- Finally, the tilde symbol `~` will bring you back to your home directory, e.g. `cd ~`

Examples:
```bash
subfolder/file.txt  # Inside a subfolder
./file.txt       # Current directory
../file.txt      # Parent directory
```

Works differently based on where the command is run.

## Relative vs. Absolute Paths

So, let's assume the project "damien-dupre.github.io", the full absolute path is:

- `C:\Users\Damien\Projects\damien-dupre.github.io`
- `Users/Damien/Projects/damien-dupre.github.io`

The content of the project's folder `damien-dupre.github.io` is:
```
.
|-- assets
|-- posts
|-- courses
|-- about.qmd
`-- and so on
```

## Relative vs. Absolute Paths

All other file- or folder-related operations are defined relative to this working directory

**The huge benefit: when you share your project with a colleague or move it to
a new computer, you only have to define the working directory once, everything
else should work flawelessly**

How to define a working directory?

`import os; os.chdir("full-path-to-working-directory")`

How to get information about the current working directory?

`import os; os.getcwd()` (cwd = current working directory); see below for an example

```python
import os 
os.getcwd()
```

## Checking Your Current Directory 

From a terminal/command line:

- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- **Windows:**
  ```cmd
  cd
  ```

## Navigating with Paths

- Moving between directories:
  ```bash
  cd /absolute/path  # Go to absolute path is always correct
  cd relative/path   # Move to relative path only if the path exists
  ```
- Special notations:
  - `.` (current directory)
  - `..` (parent directory)

## Practical Examples

- Moving into a subdirectory:
  ```bash
  cd Documents/Projects
  ```
- Moving up one level:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
- Accessing a file in a parent directory:
  ```bash
  cat ../notes.txt
  ```

## Self-Contained Projects

Contains all necessary files for your project, eportfolio or any repository in general:

- data
- results
- documentation
- scripts
- images
- designs (css/sass)
- tabs/topics

## Folder/File structure

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}

### `data`

- all raw data files, organised in meaningful ways
- never, ever write back to this folder, read only
- if using git, never commit to history, place in .gitignore

### `results`

- write all analysis etc. results to treat as disposable, can be overwritten
- may also include figures etc if wanted

### `docs`
- documentation
- Quarto files

:::

::: {#second-column}

### `src` or `py`
- if you write functions that are used in several places
- this is the standard python folder for keeping these files that might be called in python scripts

### `scripts/analysis`
- files with full analysis pipelines
- might have source calls to files in python

:::
::::

## Folder/File structure

### `README.md`
- markdown file describing the project content and intent
- maybe also explains which files to look in for what
- ideal to have if saving the folder to github

### `LICENCE`
- dictates how code can be reused
- not covering that in this series, ask me at need

## File Naming

Organising files in data/, results/, docs/, and scripts/ require some ideas of how to name files for:

- easy machine reading
- easy human reading
- easy understanding of file content
- choosing the correct type of file to store

If you are using the py/ folder to store python-functions, these might need somewhat different naming conventions than the other folders, as these are functions you can use across the other files.

Here, naming should be particularly thought in terms of content rather than structural organisation.

## File Naming

An important part of project management, code automation, and data analytics in general is to have your files read by a piece of code or software.

Machines are clever, but extremely pedantic.

Be consistent, be meticulous.

Some machines are more clever than others, so name files in a way that the "dumbest" of them can deal with.

## File Naming

- Don't use white space
  - decide on a separator and use consistently
  - recommend the dash -
- Use small case letters
  - certain machines care about capitalization
- Use numbers smartly
  - numbers are awesome to use and can help organise files meaningfully
  - but needs some thinking about before implementing
  
## File Naming

Variables and filenames should have meaningful names in `snake_case` format, preferring all lower case.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Public-Health-Scotland/python-training/1b2302fdf8c6a57e2782e9ed96d613afd40e047c/images/r_coding_cases.png")
```

## File Naming

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}

Machines will first list files starting with numbers (ascdendingly) then in alphabetic order.

```markdown
1_file.txt
2_file.txt
file_one.txt
file_three.txt
file_two.txt
```

But they wont understand the difference between 1 and 10

```markdown
10_file.txt
1_file.txt
2_file.txt
file_1.txt
file_10.txt
file_2.txt
```

:::

::: {#second-column .fragment}

'zero-padding' is a way of preserving file order

```markdown
01_file.txt
02_file.txt
10_file.txt
file_01.txt
file_02.txt
file_10.txt
```

:::
::::

## File Naming

Using dates in file names may also ensure decent organisation but be consistent. Recommend using YYYY-MM-DD formatting

```markdown
13-11-21_initial-submission-results.txt
22-01-03_revised-results.txt
2022-02-28_results.txt
```

vs

```markdown
2021-11-13_initial-submission-results.txt
2022-02-28_results.txt
2022-03-01_revised-results.txt
```

## File Naming

Consider using different space separators for different parts of the file name

This way you can use the file name it self, programatically, if needed

```markdown
2021-11-13_initial_submission_results.txt
2022-02-28_results.txt
2022-03-01_revised_results.txt
```

## File Naming

Optimising file names for computers is great, but ultimately its us humans that need to choose files to work with. Naming files in a way that makes the file content obvious (or at least give an idea of content) by the file name is good for such interactions. 

```markdown
2021-11-13_final-results.txt
2022-02-28_finalfinal-results.txt
2022-03-01_finished-results.txt
```

vs.

```markdown
2021-11-13_first-submission-results.txt
2022-02-28_revision-round1-results.txt
2022-03-01_revision-round2-results.txt
2022-03-01_revision-round2-no-sex-results.txt
```

## Image Types

Images from plots should use png or svg

- .png supports transparency and has no quality loss upon re-saving

- .svg can rescale to infinity without getting grainy

- .jpg best for photos, quality loss on rescale, blurry edges and poor text rendering

Images can also some times be saved in pdf, but pdf while a vector format, cannot support transparency.

Tiff has fallen out of favour due to high file sizes, but are preferable to jpeg for photos.

# Keep your Projects Tidy

## Project Organisation

Keep your projects tidy

> 1 folder per project and all the project folders in 1 "Projects" folder.

```
.
|-- Projects
  |-- my-project-a
  |-- my-project-b
  |-- damien-dupre.github.io

```

## Your Turn: Create your "Projects" folder  {background="#43464B"}

1. Go to the root/home of your computer using your file explorer
2. Create a "Projects" folder
3. In this "Projects" folder, create a folder called "my_first_project"
4. In a terminal use the code to print the path of "my_first_project" folder:

- `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\my_first_project`
- `cd Users/YourUsername/Projects/my_first_project`

Note, adapt the code to your home username and specific path if it's on a different location.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

## Project Management

Why do we care about project management?

<br>

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
### Portability
The ability to move the project without breaking code or needing adapting

- you will change computers
- you will reorganise your file structure
- you will share your code with others
:::

::: {#second-column}
### Reproducibility
The ability to rerun the entire process from scratch

- not just for reviews
- not just for best-practice analytics
- also for future (or even present) you
- and for your collaborators/helpers
:::
::::

## Project Workflows

:::: {layout="[1,1]"}
::: {#first-column}
### Portability
- All necessary files should be contained in the project and referenced relatively
- All necessary outputs are created by code in the project and stored in the project
:::

::: {#second-column}
### Reproducibility
- All code can be run in fresh sessions and produce the same output
- Does not force other users to alter their own work setup

## Your Turn: Type of Files in an ePortfolio {background="#43464B"}

1. Go to the GitHub Repository of my own website <https://github.com/damien-dupre/damien-dupre.github.io>
2. Download and unZip this repository on your own Computer in the Projects folder,
3. List all the file extensions of documents included in this folder and subfolders.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```
